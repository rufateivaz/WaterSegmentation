## About
In Semantic Segmentation tasks, providing datasets for the target domain is expensive (high pixel-level annotation cost). To reduce the annotation/labeling cost, one possible approach should be training the network with another but similar and already labeled dataset(s). However, in this case, the performance of the model in the target domain will more likely be poor because of the environmental distinctions of two domains. This is called <b>Domain Shift</b> problem. The domain shift problem can be tackled by <b>Domain Adaptation</b> techniques. These techniques have been applied to road scene segmentation tasks, but none of them has been implemented to reduce the annotation cost in water segmentation tasks. 

On the other hand, in our master thesis, our main research focus is on "if an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Learning method can be applied to our Water Segmentation task".

 ## Note: 
 1) Supervised Learning method is more accurate but very costly (annotation cost). Therefore, an unsupervised domain adaptation technique can be used to train the network with another but similar datasets (source domain) and the obtained knowledge can be adapted to the target domain during training.
 2) Tampere-WaterSeg is our use case (or target domain), while the source domain includes another but similar and already labeled datasets (e.g., WaterDataset, MaSTr-1325, etc).

## The explanation of the results given above: 
  1) Supervised: The segmentation model is trained and tested with Tampere-WaterSeg (costly; annotation cost).
  2) Single-NoDA: No domain adaptation method is applied. The segmentation model is trained with MaSTr-1325 dataset and evaluated with Tampere-WaterSeg dataset.
  3) Single-UDA: Single source unsupervised domain adaptation: The model is trained with MaSTr-1325 dataset (source domain) and the acquired knowledge is adapted to the target domain (Tampere-WaterSeg) during training.
  4) Multi-NoDA: No domain adaptation method is applied. The segmentation model is trained with MaSTr-1325 and WaterDataset (ADE20K + RiverDataset) datasets and evaluated with Tampere-WaterSeg dataset.
  5) Multi-UDA: Multi source unsupervised domain adaptation: The model is trained with MaSTr-1325 and WaterDataset (ADE20K + RiverDataset) datasets and the acquired knowledge is adapted to the target domain (Tampere-WaterSeg) during training.
